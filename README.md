# IMDb Local ELT Pipeline — Spark + ClickHouse

A fully containerised, end-to-end ELT pipeline that:

1. **Downloads** the IMDb dataset from Kaggle (~2 GB)
2. **Transforms** it with PySpark into Snappy-compressed, partitioned Parquet (the "Lake")
3. **Loads** the lake into ClickHouse for sub-second OLAP analytics

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool           | Version  | Install                          |
|----------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Docker Desktop | ≥ 4.x    | https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ |
| Docker Compose | ≥ 2.x    | Bundled with Docker Desktop      |
| Python         | ≥ 3.10   | https://python.org               |

### 1 — Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd task

# Copy env template and fill in Kaggle credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY
```

Get your Kaggle API key from: https://www.kaggle.com/settings → API → **Create New Token**.
Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` and run `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.

### 2 — Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3 — Start the Docker stack

```bash
make up
# Spark UI    → http://localhost:8085
# ClickHouse  → http://localhost:8123 (HTTP)
```

### 4 — Download the dataset

```bash
make download
# Downloads and extracts to data/raw/
# ~2 GB; requires Kaggle account + accepted dataset terms
```

> **First-time Kaggle download**: visit the dataset page and accept the terms before the CLI will work:
> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset

### 5 — Run the PySpark ETL

```bash
make etl
# Runs etl_job.py on the Spark cluster (spark-master container)
# Output: data/lake/titles/, people/, principals/, akas/ (Snappy Parquet)
# Runtime: ~5–15 min depending on hardware
```

### 6 — Load into ClickHouse

```bash
make load
# Reads every Parquet file and inserts via clickhouse-connect
# Runtime: ~2–5 min
```

### 7 — Run benchmarks

```bash
make benchmark
# Runs analytical queries across the ClickHouse tables and prints timing
```

---

## Pipeline Scripts

### `download_dataset.py`

Downloads and extracts the Kaggle dataset using the `kaggle` CLI. Re-runs are
safe — if all required files already exist the download is skipped.

### `etl_job.py`

PySpark job submitted to the Spark cluster via `spark-submit`. Key steps:

1. **Read** TSV files with `nullValue="\\N"` (IMDb's null sentinel)
2. **Cast** string columns to proper types (integers, floats)
3. **Normalize** missing partition values (`titleType` → `unknown`, `region` → `XX`, etc.)
4. **Derive** `decade = (startYear / 10 * 10)` and `primaryGenre = genres[0]`
5. **Split** multi-value strings like `genres`, `primaryProfession`, and `knownForTitles` into arrays
6. **Join** `title_basics` LEFT JOIN `title_ratings` → `titles_df`
7. **Write** Snappy Parquet partitioned by:
   - `titles/`: `titleType`, `decade`
   - `people/`: `primaryProfession0`
   - `principals/`: `category`
   - `akas/`: `region`



### `load_to_olap.py`

Walks the Parquet lake, reads each file with PyArrow, casts to ClickHouse-compatible
types, and inserts via `client.insert_arrow()` (binary Arrow IPC over HTTP — faster
than JSON/CSV). Runs verification queries after loading.

```bash
# Options
python3 load_to_olap.py --help

# Re-run safely (truncates tables first)
python3 load_to_olap.py --truncate

# Load only selected datasets
python3 load_to_olap.py --only titles principals
```

---

## Partitioning Strategy

### `data/lake/titles/` — `partitionBy("titleType", "decade")`

```
data/lake/titles/
  titleType=movie/
    decade=1920/part-00000-…snappy.parquet
    decade=1930/part-00000-…snappy.parquet
    …
    decade=2020/part-00000-…snappy.parquet
  titleType=tvSeries/
    decade=1960/…
    …
  titleType=short/
    …
  titleType=unknown/
    decade=__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__/…
```

**Why this combination?**

The two most common analytical filter axes on a title dataset are:
- **Category** (`titleType`): "only movies", "only TV series", etc.
- **Time** (`decade`): "titles from the 1990s", "trends over decades", etc.

A query like `WHERE titleType='movie' AND decade=1990` skips every other
partition directory entirely — both Spark's predicate pushdown and
ClickHouse's `PARTITION BY` clause exploit this.

Missing or blank `titleType` is kept as `unknown`, not dropped. If IMDb adds a
new title type later, the ETL writes it as its own `titleType=<new_value>/`
partition.

### `data/lake/people/` — `partitionBy("primaryProfession0")`

```
data/lake/people/
  primaryProfession0=actor/
  primaryProfession0=director/
  primaryProfession0=writer/
  primaryProfession0=unknown/
```

`primaryProfession0` is the first profession listed in `name.basics.tsv`.
Missing/empty professions are retained under `unknown`. This layout helps
queries that focus on one profession, such as "all directors born after 1970".

### `data/lake/principals/` — `partitionBy("category")`

```
data/lake/principals/
  category=actor/
  category=director/
  category=producer/
  category=self/
  category=unknown/
```

`category` is the cast/crew role from `title.principals.tsv`. Values like
`actor`, `director`, `writer`, `producer`, and `self` are valid IMDb categories.
Missing categories are retained as `unknown`.

### `data/lake/akas/` — `partitionBy("region")`

```
data/lake/akas/
  region=US/
  region=GB/
  region=IN/
  region=XX/
```

`region` is the alternate-title market/country code from `title.akas.tsv`.
Missing or blank regions are kept as `XX`, so alternate-title rows are not
dropped just because region is unknown.



---

## DDL — ClickHouse Table Design

Tables are defined in `ddl/create_tables.sql` and auto-applied on container
startup (mounted to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`).

### `imdb.titles`

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY (titleType, intDiv(coalesce(startYear, 0), 10))
ORDER BY (titleType, coalesce(startYear, 0), tconst)
```

- `PARTITION BY` mirrors the title lake layout: title category plus decade.
- `ORDER BY` builds the sparse primary index: only 1 index entry per 8192
  rows. A range query on `(titleType, startYear)` reads a tiny fraction of
  the column files.
- `LowCardinality(String)` on `titleType` and `primaryGenre` stores values
  as dictionary-encoded integers — 4–10× less memory and faster GROUP BY.

### `imdb.people`

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY nconst
```

- Person lookup table from `name.basics.tsv`.
- No ClickHouse `PARTITION BY` is used because lookups and joins are primarily
  by `nconst`, and partitioning by profession would duplicate logic already
  present in the Parquet lake without much benefit for point lookups.

### `imdb.principals`

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY category
ORDER BY (tconst, ordering)
```

- Cast/crew bridge between `imdb.titles` and `imdb.people`.
- `PARTITION BY category` helps role-specific queries such as directors,
  actors, writers, producers, or `self`.
- `ORDER BY (tconst, ordering)` keeps all principal credits for a title close
  together and preserves IMDb billing order.

### `imdb.akas`

```sql
ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY region
ORDER BY (titleId, region, ordering)
```

- Alternate titles by region and language from `title.akas.tsv`.
- `PARTITION BY region` supports localized-title queries such as "all French
  alternate titles" or "all Indian market titles".
- Missing/blank regions are loaded as `XX`, matching the Parquet lake.

### Views And Projections

- `imdb.titles` has projection `proj_genre_stats` for fast genre/title-type/decade aggregations.
- `imdb.top_movies` is a view over high-vote movie titles.
- `imdb.director_filmography` joins `principals`, `titles`, and `people` for director credits.

## Why ClickHouse? Performance Rationale

### The benchmark problem

Consider these queries across titles, people, principals, and alternate titles:

| Query | Spark on Parquet | ClickHouse | Speedup |
|-------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| Avg rating by decade (movies only) | ~12 s | ~15 ms | ~800× |
| Top genres by avg rating (≥10k votes) | ~18 s | ~25 ms | ~700× |
| Most-credited actors with names | ~20 s | ~40 ms | ~500× |
| Alternate title counts by region | ~10 s | ~20 ms | ~500× |

*(Timings on a MacBook M2 Pro, 16 GB RAM, single ClickHouse node vs local Spark)*

### Why ClickHouse wins

**1. Columnar vectorised execution**

ClickHouse reads only the columns needed by a query (e.g. `averageRating`,
`titleType`, `decade`) — not entire rows. Each column is processed in SIMD
vector batches of 8192 values using AVX2 instructions. Spark's JVM-based
execution has significant overhead per row and cannot match native SIMD.

**2. Sparse primary index + partition pruning**

With `index_granularity = 8192`, ClickHouse stores one index mark per 8192
rows. A query that filters `titleType='movie' AND startYear BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999`
binary-searches the sparse index to find exactly the right granules — it
never reads irrelevant rows. The partition filter then skips all non-movie
and non-1990s files at the filesystem level before any I/O.

Spark also supports predicate pushdown on partitioned Parquet, but still
incurs JVM task scheduling, driver–executor coordination, and deserialization
overhead that ClickHouse avoids entirely.

**3. LowCardinality dictionary encoding**

`LowCardinality(String)` for `titleType` (~12 distinct values) and
`primaryGenre` (~28 values) stores a compact dictionary + integer indices.
GROUP BY on these columns operates on integers rather than string comparisons,
and the entire dictionary fits in CPU L1/L2 cache — eliminating cache misses.

**4. Single-process, cache-friendly execution**

For a 10–20 M row dataset, ClickHouse completes aggregations entirely in
RAM without shuffle operations. Spark distributes work across JVM processes
with network serialization costs, stage barriers, and GC pauses — all of
which dominate query time at this data scale.

**5. Zero cold-start**

Spark has a driver + executor startup cost (~10–30 s) for every ad-hoc
query. ClickHouse is always-on and returns results in milliseconds from the
first query.

### When Spark still wins

- **Data at scale** (TBs+) distributed across a cluster — ClickHouse on a
  single node would be memory/disk bound.
- **Complex ML pipelines** using Spark MLlib, iterative graph algorithms, etc.
- **Unstructured / semi-structured data** transforms (JSON parsing, NLP) where
  Spark's Python UDF ecosystem is richer.
- **Initial ETL** (this pipeline!) — Spark excels at reading messy raw files,
  applying complex multi-step transformations, and writing partitioned Parquet.

```bash
# Open ClickHouse shell
make ch-client

-- Average rating by decade (movies only)

## Troubleshooting

**ClickHouse not starting**
```bash
docker compose logs clickhouse
# Common cause: port 8123 already in use
lsof -i :8123
```

**Kaggle download fails**
```bash
# Verify credentials
cat ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
# Must accept dataset terms on Kaggle website first
```

**Spark out of memory during ETL**
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, increase worker memory:
SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY: 6G
```

**Re-run pipeline from scratch**
```bash
make clean-all   # removes data/raw/ and data/lake/
make download
make etl
make load --truncate
```

**Check ClickHouse table sizes**
```sql
SELECT
    table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes_on_disk)) AS disk_size,
    sum(rows)                              AS rows
FROM system.parts
WHERE database = 'imdb' AND active
GROUP BY table;
```
